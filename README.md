Orchid
======

Orchid is a game that was developed for the Ludum Dare 28 Jam by Jim Nguyen, Darwin Pek, and William Vickery. You can view and play the game at the official Ludum Dare website  [here](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=15471).

The latest version of this repository is a mostly unaltered version of the game that was submitted to Ludum Dare.


Setup
-----

Orchid uses a proprietary third party plugin called tk2d. This Unity plugin can be obtained at the [official tk2d site](http://www.unikronsoftware.com/2dtoolkit/) and is not included in this repository.

In order to build the game, you will need to import version 2.3.0 (or newer) of tk2d into the Unity Project.
